SUMMARY                        *veil*

Veil helps you ignore your inner editor (can't edit what you can't see!) and hides your prose from prying or innocent eyes.

Define a key with something like this in your .vimrc:
>
	nmap <F12> <Plug>Veil
<

You may define a custom color:
>
	let g:veilcolor="black"
<
